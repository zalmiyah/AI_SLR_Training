Here are three research questions related to using genetic algorithms for the scheduling of production:

1. **Optimization and Scalability**: How can genetic algorithms be further optimized and scaled to handle complex production scheduling problems in large-scale manufacturing environments, ensuring efficient resource allocation and minimizing production delays?

2. **Integration with Real-time Data**: What approaches can be developed to integrate real-time data from sensors and IoT devices into genetic algorithms for production scheduling, enabling adaptive and responsive scheduling decisions that account for dynamic changes in production conditions and demand?

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: How can genetic algorithms be extended to address multi-objective production scheduling problems, where conflicting objectives such as minimizing production costs, maximizing resource utilization, and meeting delivery deadlines need to be simultaneously optimized, and what techniques can be employed to provide decision-makers with a range of Pareto-optimal solutions for better decision support?
